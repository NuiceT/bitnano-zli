## Introduction

The Bitcoin protocol is the most popular cryptographic protocol worldwide. Since I am a big fan of Bitcoin and its protocol, I always wanted to create something similar my own. This is how i came to [the idea](#the-idea) of Bitnano as a final project in the ZÃ¼rcher Lehrbetriebsverband ICT.

## The idea

![idea](assets/01-the-idea.png)

### Description

Traditional banks need time and trust to process a transfer. Bitcoin replaces (central) banks with a decentral Blockchain. In the Bitcoin Blockchain, a Block has a maximum size of **1 MiB**. Approximately every **10 minutes** a new Block gets mined.
The idea of Bitnano is to create a faster Blockchain, but with a lower size of Blocks. The maximum size of a Bitnano-Block is **512 KiB**, with an average time of **5 minutes** per Block to mine.

## Realization

### Core

#### Block

The idea of a block, is to include transactions and getting mined by miners. As in Bitcoin, I wanted blocks including a hash and transactions. So I designed the [UML](#uml-diagrams) for the block and started programming immediately. I think there is nothing much more to say, as i got some inspiration from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4).

##### Hash calculation

To calculate a Block hash, I used a simple 256-bit SHA algorithm. The functionality looks like this:

It's not really that hard, just implementation from the existing node.js [crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) library.

##### Block mining

To mine a block, you'll have to get the blockchains difficulty by providing it to the method. The difficulty is being set, by only allowing hashes, with a specific amount of zeros. For example: `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`<br>
After that, it really isn't hard to start the mining, it's just luck and performance. That's how proof-of-work works.

#### Blockchain

##### Connection between Blocks

As in every proof-of-work blockchain, the blocks are connected with their hash including the hash of the block before. For example:

##### Don't trust, verify

To verify the blockchain, you can just recalculate the blocks with the same properties as the already calculated hash and compare it. With this, you don't have to trust and verify everything yourself.

##### Pending transaction

Pending transactions are currently being saved in a JSON file. The core reads that file and includes the pending transaction into newly mined blocks. Afterwards, the pending transactions get purged.
