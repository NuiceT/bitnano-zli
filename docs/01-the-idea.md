## Description

Traditional banks need time and trust to process a transfer. Bitcoin replaces (central) banks with a decentral Blockchain. In the Bitcoin Blockchain, a Block has a maximum size of **1 MiB**. Approximately every **10 minutes** a new Block gets mined.
The idea of Bitnano is to create a faster Blockchain, but with a lower size of Blocks. The maximum size of a Bitnano-Block is **512 KiB**, with an average time of **5 minutes** per Block to mine.
